          New to the coding world! I have recently graduated from UCSD's Coding
          Bootcamp as of June 2022! I love problem solving, thinking out side of
          the box, and making new ideas come to life which is why I decided to
          get into Web Development. Previously I was in the Metrology field
          working as a Calibration and Repair Technician for over five years.{" "}
          <br />
          While working for my last employer I was exposed to Python. We used
          Python to create automated testing procedures for Rohde and Schwarz,
          Keysight, Tektronix, LeCroy, Kiethley, and National Instruments
          precision test equipment. This is were my interests in coding began!
          Since then I have learned so many new skills and I am beyond excited
          to learn even more and grow as a Full Stack Web Developer.
