          New to the coding world and recent graduate of UCSD's Coding Bootcamp!
          I love problem solving, thinking out side of the box, making new ideas
          come to life, and challenging myself which is why I decided to get
          into Web Development. Previously a Metrologist but have now set out to
          begin a new career as a Full Stack Web Developer.

          <br />
          My intrests in coding first started when I was exposed to Python by a
          previous employer. We were using Python to create automated test
          scripts for Keysight, Tektronix, LeCroy, Kiethley, and National
          Instruments precision test equipment. I was amazed by the ability to
          drastically improve productivity and saw the endless possiblities this
          tool could provide.
          <br />
          <br />
          While working with these scripts my curiousity grew, so I did some
          research to see what else was out there. I was quick to find that I
          hadn't even begain to scratch the surface of "coding" and is why I
          enrolled in UCSD's Coding Bootcamp. I am beyond exited to grow in this
          field and be apart of an awesome community!
