          New to the coding world and recent graduate of UCSD's Coding Bootcamp:
          I love challenges, problem solving, thinking outside the box, and
          making new ideas come to life. My interests in coding first started
          when I was exposed to Python while working as a Calibration
          Technician.
          <br />
          <br />
          We used Python to create automated test scripts for Keysight,
          Tektronix, LeCroy, Kiethley, and National Instruments precision test
          equipment. I was amazed by the ability to drastically improve
          productivity and saw the endless possiblities this tool could provide.
          <br />
          <br />
          While working with these scripts my curiousity grew, so I did some
          research to see what else was out there. I was quick to find that I
          hadn't even began to scratch the surface of coding. Which is why I
          enrolled in UCSD's Coding Bootcamp.
