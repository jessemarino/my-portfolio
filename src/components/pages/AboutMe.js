          Previously I was a calibration and repair technician with over five
          years of experiance in the Metrology field. While working as a
          calibration technincian I was introduced to Python which I used to
          write automated testing procedures for Rohde and Schwarz, Keysight,
          Tektronix, LeCroy, Kiethley, and National Instruments precision test
          equipment. <br />
          As my intrest in Python grew I became more curious in other
          technologies. I decided to change career paths and get into the web
          development world by attending UCSD's Coding BootCamp. I graduated
          June of 2022 and have gained the nessessary skills to become a Full
          Stack Web Developer.
