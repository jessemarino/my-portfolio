      <p>
        Previously a calibration and repair technician for five years. I started
        my carrer during my time in the Marine Corps while stationed on Camp
        Pendelton. After that I began working for Avalon Test Equipment where I
        gained tons of experiance in the telecommunitcation and RF side of
        Metrology
        <br />I decieded that I needed a change of pace and since I'm always
        trying to learn and gain new skill sets, I enrolled in UCSD's Coding
        Bootcamp. Where I hope to gain all of the skills I will need to become a
        sucsessful full stack devloper.
