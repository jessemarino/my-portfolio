            New to the coding world and recent graduate of UCSD's Coding
            Bootcamp: I love challenges, problem solving, making new ideas come
            to life, and thinking outside the box. My interests in coding first
            started when I was exposed to Python while working as a Calibration
            Technician. I used Python to create automated test scripts for
            Keysight, Tektronix, LeCroy, Kiethley, and National Instruments
            precision test equipment. I was amazed by the ability to drastically
            improve productivity and saw the endless possiblities this tool
            could provide. While working with these scripts my curiousity grew,
            so I did some research to see what else was out there. I was quick
            to find that I hadn't even begun to scratch the surface of coding.
            Which is why I enrolled in UCSD's Coding Bootcamp. Currently I'm
            intrested in learning AWS and would like to create my first game
            using Unity. Amongst coding, my other hobbies include: camping,
            learing to play the guitar, skating, writing, and cooking.
