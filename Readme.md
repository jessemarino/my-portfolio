## Description

My motivation for this project was to rebuild my old portfolio to something new! I built this app to test my skills with React. I think this solves app solves my problem by giving me a portfolio that looks more originized and a better foundation than the previous.After briefly working on this app I feel like it gave me a better understanding of styling a webpage with React.
